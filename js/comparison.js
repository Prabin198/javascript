// console.log(5<6); here output is true because output in comparision comes in boolean form
// console.log(5!=6);
// console.log("3">2); using this is mess because comparison should be done with same datatypes
 console.log(null>0); //we get false because 0 is not greater than 0
console.log(null==0);//we get false because in only comparision the value of null is changed to 0
 console.log(null>=0);//we get true because it is comparision and also true statement
 

 console.log(undefined>0);//avoid this type of cases
 console.log(undefined==0);//every output is false
 console.log(undefined>=0);
  console.log("2"=== 2);//it gives false because of wrong operator
